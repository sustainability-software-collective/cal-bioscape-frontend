# Task Summaries Archive

This directory contains archived summaries of completed tasks and project milestones.

## Purpose

To keep the project root clean and organized, task summaries for completed work are stored here for reference. This is distinct from documentation files, which are stored in the `/docs` directory.

## Contents
